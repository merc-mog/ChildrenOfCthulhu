Children of CthulhuREAD MESooooo the main menu works for the first time around, but any time after you enter the game and go back to the Main Menu the game breaks and won’t go past the load screen. :)You’ll want to play the game in windowed mode or just alt tab out of the game and close/restart it to begin again. Good luck!P.S. the game doesn’t tell you when the level is done. Just know that when sustenance is at 150 you’ve got all the enemies for that first level. Also, there is only one level. Thanks and stuff :)
